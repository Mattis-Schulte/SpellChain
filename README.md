### Setup and Execution Instructions:

To start the game, execute the file `spiel.py` using PowerShell or CMD. Ensure that you are in the "SpellChain" directory and that the correct version of Python is installed. No additional libraries are required.

If you want to use the larger Wiktionary dictionary, copy and replace the files from the `wiktionary_impl` folder into the main `SpellChain` folder and run `spiel.py` from there.

For more detailed information about the game, refer to the `spellchain_docs.pdf` file located in the `LaTeX` folder.
